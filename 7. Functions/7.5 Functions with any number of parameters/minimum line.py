# Declare a function named str_min that compares two given strings and returns the minimum of them
# (that is, it performs a lexicographic string comparison). Then, using a functional programming approach
# (that is, more complex functions are implemented by calling simpler ones), implement two more similar functions:
#
# - with the name str_min3 to find the minimum string of the three strings passed;
# - named str_min4 to find the minimum string of the four strings passed.
#
# You do not need to execute functions, only write.


def str_min(*args):
    return min(*args)


def str_min3(*args):
    return min(*args)


def str_min4(*args):
    return min(*args)
