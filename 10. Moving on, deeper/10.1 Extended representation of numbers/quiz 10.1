in this lesson we do not solve examples, but there is a quiz:

1)  The number in exponential notation is:
        1e-2
    Write it in the usual decimal form.
    This feat should be done without the help of a Python interpreter, only on your own.
    >> 0.01

2)  The number in exponential notation is:
        7.8e2
    Write it in the usual decimal form.
    This feat should be done without the help of a Python interpreter, only on your own.
    >> 780

3)  The number in binary notation looks like:
        0b1010
    Write it in the usual decimal form.
    This feat should also be done without the help of a Python interpreter, only on your own.
    >> 10

4)  The number in binary notation looks like:
        0b101101
    Write it in the usual decimal form.
    This feat should also be done without the help of a Python interpreter, only on your own.
    >> 45

5)  Check all the correct ways to write numbers in Python.
