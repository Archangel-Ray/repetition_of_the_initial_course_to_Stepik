in this lesson we do not solve examples, but there is a quiz:

1)  What does the open function do?
    >> opens a file for reading or writing

2)  The path to the text.dat file looks like this:
    C:/python/course/dat/text.dat
    The executable Python program is located in the directory:
    C:/python/course
    Check all valid paths to this file relative to the executable program.
    >> C:/python/course/dat/text.dat
    >> dat/text.dat

3)  When calling the open function to open the text.dat file:
    file = open('text.dat')
    file opens on:
    >> reading

4)  hat will happen as a result of executing the command:
    file = open('text.dat', encoding='utf-8')
    >> the text.dat file is opened for reading in UTF-8 encoding

5)  What happens when you run the commands:
    file = open('text.dat', encoding='utf-8')
    r = file.read(4)
    >> the first 4 characters will be read from the text.dat file (characters can consist of several bytes)

6)  What does the seek method do in the following code snippet:
    file = open('text.dat', encoding='utf-8')
    r = file.read(40)
    file.seek(0)
    >> sets the file position to the beginning

7)  What is the file tell method for?
    >> returns the current position of the file

8)  The text.dat file contains the lines:
        - Tell me, uncle, it's not for nothing
        I learned Python with a channel
        What did Balakirev hand out?
    What will the variables t1 and t2 contain when the following program fragment is executed:
        file = open('text.dat', encoding='utf-8')
        t1 = file.readline()
        t2 = file.readline()
    >> t1 is the first line and t2 is the second line

9)  What does the readlines file method return?
    >> a list of all lines in a file

10) Why close a file with the close method after working with it?
    >> to free the resources associated with this file
    >> so that the data written to the file is not lost
