there is one example in this tutorial, and of course there is a quiz:

1)  What happens if you try to open a non-existent file for reading?
    >> a FileNotFoundError error will occur

2)  What is the with context manager for when working with files?
    >> it allows you to automatically close the file

3)  There is a program fragment:
        file = open('my_file.txt')
        s = file.readline()
        file.close()
    What is the right way to write a context manager here?
    >> with open("my_file.txt") as file: ...

4)  When is the finally block executed in a try/except/finally construct?
    >> always after the execution of the try and except blocks

5)  When is the except block executed in a try / except / finally construct?
    >> when appropriate errors occur in the try block
