a very difficult lesson and unfortunately there is only a quiz in it.
for such lessons, many tasks are needed to get the skill of working with files.
quiz questions of this lesson:

1)  Check all access modes for writing information to a file.
    >> w
    >> wb
    >> a+
    >> a

2)  What happens if you open a non-existent file for writing?
    >> a new empty file will be created

3)  Check the file methods that allow you to write information to a file in text access mode.
    >> writelines
    >> write

4)  What will be written to the out.txt file when the following program fragment is executed:
        try:
            with open('out.txt', 'w') as file:
                file.write('Hello')
                file.write('Hello')
        except:
            print('Error while working with file')
    >> two lines 'Hello' one after the other (in a line)

5)  What happens if you do not close the file (using the close method) when writing information to it?
    >> some recorded data may be lost

6)  What is the 'a+' access mode used for?
    >> for adding information to a file and reading previously recorded data

7)  There is a list of lines:
        t = ['- Tell me, uncle, it's not for nothing',
            'I learned Python with a channel',
            'What was Balakirev handing out?']
    What is the easiest way to write them to a file (at once)?
    >> writelines

8)  What file access modes are binary?
    >> wb
    >> rb

9)  Suppose we want to save the entire dictionary d to the file file using the pickle module in binary mode:
        d = {'car': 'машина', 'tree': 'дерево', 'road': 'дорога'}
    Choose the command that correctly performs this action.
    >> pickle.dump(d, file)

10) Suppose we want to read a dictionary from file file using the pickle module in binary mode.
    Choose the command that correctly performs this action.
    >> d = pickle.load(file)
